# Hybrid Authorship, System Provenance, and License Notice

## Hybrid Authorship
This repository and all included materials were developed through a hybrid creative process, combining direct human authorship and AI-assisted tooling under continuous human oversight.  
All architectural designs, system structures, codebases, runtime environments, and documentation were conceived, directed, and finalized exclusively by **Charles E. Drain** (professionally known as **CHUCK**).  
AI models were utilized strictly as accelerators within a supervised creative framework, without autonomous decision-making authority.

## System Provenance
- **chuckOS™** — Proprietary operating system developed and governed by **chuck native systems**, R&D division of **CHUCKcorp**.
- **aiOS™** — Proprietary AI-native firmware environment (pre-boot, UEFI/BIOS equivalents, runtime orchestration layers) engineered and owned by **CHUCKcorp**.

Artifacts in this repository are designed, verified, and validated for operation within the chuckOS™ ecosystem.  
This publication acts as timestamped evidence of authorship, provenance, and originality, establishing public disclosure and first use under international intellectual property law.
